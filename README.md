# Homework 7 README Generator
## Description
#### For this assignment, I have created a markdown file generator that runs based on user input.  The user is asked a series of questions, and the responses are transfered to a .md file formatted correctly and legibly.  The user is able to choose from a list of licenses to display a badge at the top of the page.  The table of contents contains links to move to the specified section of the page. The user's email address and github links are placed at the bottom of the page.
